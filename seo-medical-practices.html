<h2>
Why Your Medical Practice Needs Search Engine Optimization</h2>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Search Engine Optimization for Medical practices is a process that will help you to have more organic traffic on your website, will help you that those people that come to your site looking for health-related issue answers convert to be your patients.<br />
<br /></div>
<h2 style="font-family: georgia, serif;">
Why is Necessary for Doctors to Have a Website</h2>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Physicians, Dentists and everyone with a medical practice now need to have a website that represents them and their clinics.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
When I say a website represents them I mean that websites represent their work and sometimes they represent even their personality.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
Now almost everybody searches on their phones for everything, and that doesn't exclude their medical conditions, health tips, weight-loss tips, etc...</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">

<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">

<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
But, what all that has to do with you?</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
Well if you are a medical doctor or dentists then that definitively have a lot to do with you, because your patients already are using their phones to ask for their medical conditions and if you are not present on the internet giving answers than you should know that your competition is already doing that.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
</div>

<br />
If other doctors that are your competition are giving answers to your existing patients than do not be surprised when your patients are going to change you as a doctor with them.<br />
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
But that's not all!</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
If you have a website where you blog and give health tips than people who search on the internet and can get answers from your website then chances are that they can easily turn to be your patients and therefore you can grow your patient base.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
So I hope by now you have been convinced that you definitely need to have a website.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<h2 style="font-family: georgia, serif;">
What kind of website medical and healthcare practices should have?</h2>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
The most important thing is having a website, but what kind of website you should have?<br />
<br />
You should have an informative website with medical and healthcare topics where searchers and your potential patients can find answers they are looking for.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter what kind of CMS (content management system) you will use to create e manage your website as long as it is an informative and SEO friendly website.<br />
<br />
Although I always recommend using Wordpress, static website or even Blogger for your website.<br />
<br />
<h2>
What Kind of Information Should You Put On Your Medical Website?</h2>
<br />
When I say you should have an informative site, I mean you should have information in there that will help your site visitors to find answers to their questions that they have.<br />
<br />
First, you should have information about your clinic, like an address&nbsp;where are you located, your phone number, info about you as a medical professional, info about services that you offer, etc...<br />
<br />
After this, you should be having a blog to write about various health and medical topics, so that you can give information to your website searchers or potential&nbsp;patients.<br />
<br />
You should know what to write by doing keyword and other types of search engine optimization research.<br />
<br />
<h2>
You Have Created a Website, Placed Information on it, What Should You Do Next?</h2>
</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
Well now that you have done the first part if the work, now you should start blogging and also doing SEO for your medical practice.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
&nbsp;You should have a clear content marketing plan for blogging.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
By content marketing plan I mean doing research on what to write, scheduling your posts on when to publish them, communicating with your site visitors, etc...</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
You should also start optimizing your website for search engines and for your visitors, and by this, I mean helping search engine crawlers to easily crawl your website, and creating a great UX (user experience) for your website visitors and this will help you convert your visitors to patients.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
When it comes to converting your site visitors to become your patients you need more than just a good UX, but also a great CRO (convert rate optimization) by knowing how to optimize your post titles or headlines, your meta description and by this you will increase CTR (click-through rate) and now with the Rankbrain algorithm Google algorithm) you will increase rankings on SERPs (search engine result pages).<br />
<br />
<h2>

<br />
<h2>
Structured Data Markup for the SEO of Medical Practices</h2>
<br />
Structured data markup are lines of codes that you can place on your website and that will help search engines to better understand the content of your website and this will sure help you rank better.<br />
<br />
But, that's not all, now Google when somebody makes a question on their search field by typing it or even by voice search, Google have presented an answer box with the answer to the searchers question and that answer usually is taken from the most relevant website that has their answer on their website and having structured data markup present helps that the answer to be taken from your website.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<h2 style="font-family: georgia, serif;">
You Should Promote Your Medical Blog Posts</h2>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
After creating amazing health and medical articles for your blog, you should start promoting them so that you can gain traffic to those pages on your website and increase your overall visibility and authority in the eyes of your website visitors.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
By promoting your website and your blog posts you will obtain backlinks to your site articles, your website, you will get social shares for your posts, and this will lead in an increase of your site's overall <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority" target="_blank">domain authority</a>.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
Google and other search engines treat backlinks as the most important ranking factor and therefore you need to obtain as many backlinks as you can.<br />
<br />
But, you should be careful with backlinks because you can get a penalty and you can for getting backlinks just for the sake of getting backlinks.<br />
<br />
You should try to get natural editorial backlinks because those matter the most when it comes to getting a boost in SERPs.<br />
<br />
Editorial backlinks are also the hardest to get because you need to have amazing content so that people will link to you, you need to know how to promote that content, etc...<br />
<br />
But you should focus also on getting social media shares and because of that you should create social media business profile pages and have a clear social media strategy.<br />
<br />
<h2>
Create a Local SEO Strategy for Your Medical and Healthcare Practice</h2>
</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
When it comes to medical practices, local SEO is very important, because most patients that you will get to your clinic are going to be from your city, town or region.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
There should be written a clear local SEO strategy, on how to create listings of your business on Google, Yelp, and other places where you can get a listing or a citation.</div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">
But not only listing but also reviews of your clinic are what matters for search engines, so having as more positive reviews are going to be very important.<br />
